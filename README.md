This repository is an implementation of a great paper by Tanay Roy and Farjana Jaishmin Sonia from Jadavpur University, India. It is called “_**A Direct Method To Generate Pythagorean Triples And Its Generalization To Pythagorean Quadruples And n-tuples**_”. I am very thankful to them.

If you would like (which I highly recommend) to read their paper, you can find it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2145).
